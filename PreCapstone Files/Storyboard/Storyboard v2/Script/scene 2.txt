EXT. Mercury Wasteland Landscape - DAY
The sun is high and the red dessert landscape is peppered with little foliage. A small town lies in the background.

An orange portal opens in mid-air, and out comes KATIE, RAVEN, and SPENCER. KATIE and RAVEN land on their feet, but SPENCER falls on his butt.

SPENCER
Oof!

RAVEN
You've Jumped us too far out of town. Now we have to walk.

KATIE
I didn't want to be seen by any of the locals!

SPENCER
What was THAT?

KATIE and RAVEN look at SPENCER, then look back at each other.

RAVEN
...You mean you don't Know?

KATIE
It's called Jumping. We travel the multiverse to answer calls for help.

SPENCER
Multiverse?

MONSTER
(Off screen)
RAAAAWWWWRRRR!

KATIE
Look out!
(shoves SPENCER out of the way as a fuzzy hand slams down where he was standing.)
