INT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Looks like the inside of a Log Cabin. 
RAVEN leans on doorway in BG, KATIE stands in MG.

KATIE
I'm Katie, and this is Raven. Welcome to the team, Spencer!

SHOT - MID
SPENCER looks pensive or inquisitive.

SPENCER
Team?

REVERSE

KATIE
We're heroes! We help people!

RAVEN
(camera focuses on him)
Are you done yet? We need to go.

KATIE
(turns toward Raven, her confidence wavers)
Y-yeah...Spencer, stand here.

SPENCER
(Gets up and joins Katie and Raven in middle of shot)

Katie pulls out a device and starts fiddling with it.

RAVEN
We're going to M1457 location 58--

KATIE
I KNOW what I'm doing, Raven

RAVEN
Then make sure you get it RIGHT this time.

An orange portal appears on the floor, and they all drop through it.
