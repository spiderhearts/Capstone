EXT. Mercury Wasteland

This is a fight scene. A fuzzy monster has attacked the trio. Katie has just shoved Spencer out of the way. Spencer still doesn't quite understand what's going on. RAVEN ducks behind a rock.

KATIE tries to conjure fire in her hand, but the bracelet on her wrist shocks her.

KATIE
(in pain)
Ouch! Raven! Turn the Limiter off!

Spencer looks down at his wrist and notices that he has a Limiter on his wrist as well.

RAVEN
(Pulls a device out of his pocket)
Ugh. This is stupid. Don't engage!


Katie dodges a blow from MONSTER.

KATIE
I don't think we have a choice!

RAVEN
Ugh, fine.
(He disengages the Limiter)

Katie uses fire propusion to boost herself into the air, and lands a ferocious fire punch.

RAVEN
You're not going to beat it. Just give it a couple of good hits so that we can run away!

MONSTER yells in pain and charges at her, but she dodges and lands a kick.

KATIE
Oh! Like you could do any better. You're hiding behind a rock!

MONSTER doubles down in pain before swiping at her.

RAVEN
Yeah! You've got to learn to pick your battles!

MONSTER catches KATIE'S foot and she falls down.

KATIE
Ah!

MONSTER prepares to land the final blow.

MONSTER
(Ferociously)
RAAAWWRRR

SPENCER in the background sees that KATIE is not going to move in time.

SPENCER
Look out!

Spencer opens up a portal and dives in.

A portal opens up next to Katie and Spencer appears. The portal closes as soon as he leaves it

KATIE
(surprised)
How did you--?

SPENCER grabs KATIE and they both dive through a new portal.

The MONSTER stumbles as his target is no longer there. He looks around, confused.

The landscape is empty.

MONSTER shrugs his shoulders and saunters off.

RAVEN pops out from behind a rock and dusts himself off.
